Welcome to Haddock's documentation!
===================================

Haddock is a framework for easily creating APIs. It uses Python and Twisted, and supports both CPython 2.7 and PyPy.

Haddock revolves around versions - it is designed so that you can write code for new versions of your API without disturbing old ones. You simply expand the scope of the unchanged methods, and copy a reference into your new version.
