Haddock is a framework for easily creating APIs. It uses Python and Twisted, and supports both CPython 2.7 and PyPy.

Haddock revolves around versions - it is designed so that you can write code for new versions of your API without disturbing old ones. You simply expand the scope of the unchanged methods, and copy a reference into your new version.

You can get the MIT-licensed code on `GitHub <https://github.com/hawkowl/haddock>`_, or download it from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/haddock>`_.
