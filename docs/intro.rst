Introduction - Getting Off The Ground
=====================================

Haddock was made to help you create simple APIs that divide cleanly over versions, with minimal fuss - Haddock takes care of routing, assembly, parameter checking and (optionally) authentication for you. All you have to do is provide your business logic.


Installing
==========

To install, you simply need to run::
    
    pip install haddock

This'll install Haddock and all its dependencies.


A Very Simple Example
=====================

In this introduction, we will create a *Planet Information* API. We will create something that will allow us to query it, and will return some information about planets. So, first, let's define our API.

Simple API Definition
---------------------

Put the following in ``planets.json``::

    {
        "metadata": {
            "name": "planetinfo",
            "friendlyName": "Planet Information",
            "versions": [1]
        },
        "api": [
            {
                "name": "yearlength",
                "friendlyName": "Year Length of Planets",
                "endpoint": "yearlength",
                "getProcessors": [
                    {
                        "versions": [1],
                        "requiredParams": ["name"]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

Now, we have made a ``metadata`` section that gives three things:

- The 'name' of our API.
- The 'friendly name' (human-readable) name of our API.
- A list of versions that our API has (right now, just 1).

We then define an ``api`` section, which is a list of our different APIs. We have defined only one here, and we have said that:

- It has a name of 'yearlength'.
- It has a human-readable name of 'Year Length of Planets'.
- It has an endpoint of 'yearlength'. Haddock structures APIs as ``/<VERSION>/<ENDPOINT>``, so this means that a v1 of it will be at ``/v1/yearlength``.

There is also then ``getProcessors`` - a list of *processors*. A processor in Haddock is the code that actually does the heavy lifting. This one here only has two things - a list of versions that this processor applies to (in this case, just ``1``), and a list of required parameters (just the one, ``name``).

Using this API description, we can figure out that our future API will be at ``/v1/yearlength`` and require a single parameter - the name of the planet.

Now, lets make the processor behind it.

Simple Python Implementation
----------------------------

Put the following in ``planets.py``::

    import json
    from haddock.api import API

    class PlanetAPI(object):
        class v1(object):
            def yearlength_GET(self, request, params):
                pass

    APIDescription = json.load(open("planets.json"))
    myAPI = API(PlanetAPI, APIDescription)
    myAPI.getApp().run("127.0.0.1", 8094)

This example can be this brief because Haddock takes care of nearly everything else.

So, let's break it down. 

1. First we import ``API`` from ``haddock.api`` - this is what takes care of creating your API from the config.
2. We then create a ``PlanetAPI`` class, and make a subclass called ``v1``. This corresponds to version 1 of your API.
3. We then create a method called ``yearlength_GET``. This is done in a form of ``<NAME>_<METHOD>``. It has three parameters - ``self`` (this is special, we'll get to it later), ``request`` (the Twisted.Web Request for the API call) and ``params`` (rather than have to parse them yourself, Haddock does this for you).

Currently, ``yearlength_GET`` does nothing, so lets fill in some basic functionality - for brevity, we'll only support Earth and Pluto.
::

    def yearlength_GET(self, request, params):
        planetName = params["name"].lower()
        if planetName == "earth":
            return {"seconds": 31536000}
        elif planetName == "pluto":
            return {"seconds": 7816176000}

As you can see, we access ``params``, which is a dict of all the things given to you in the API call. This is sorted out by Haddock, according to your API description - it makes sure that all required parameters are there, and throws an error if it is not.

We then return a ``dict`` with our result. You can do this - Haddock will JSONise it automatically for you.

Running
-------

Let's try and run it!

``python planets.py``

This should print something out like this::

    2013-12-27 11:46:21+0800 [-] Log opened.
    2013-12-27 11:46:21+0800 [-] Site starting on 8094
    2013-12-27 11:46:21+0800 [-] Starting factory <twisted.web.server.Site instance at 0x192d998>

This says that the Twisted.Web server behind Haddock has started up, and is on the port we asked it to.

Now, go to ``http://localhost:8094/v1/yearlength?name=earth`` in your web browser. You should get the following back::

    {"status": "success", "data": {"seconds": 31536000}}

Now try ``http://localhost:8094/v1/yearlength`` - that is, without specifying the name.
::

    {"status": "fail", "data": "Missing request parameters: 'name'"}

As you can see, it fails if we don't pass in what we want.

API Documentation
-----------------

Tired of having to document your APIs? Well, with Haddock, you can provide basic API documentation *automatically*. Simply go back to your ``planets.json`` and make your ``metadata`` look like this::

    "metadata": {
        "name": "planetinfo",
        "friendlyName": "Planet Information",
        "versions": [1],
        "apiInfo": true
    },

Then restart your ``planets.py`` and browse to ``http://localhost:8094/v1/apiInfo``. You will get a list of what APIs you have, and some request and response params. It is a bit lacking right now - you'll only have ``name`` in Request Arguments with no other documentation, but you'll find out how to add descriptions and types to this documentation in the more advanced articles.
