Haddock
=======

Haddock is a micro-framework for creating APIs, as well as a JSON-based API description language. It uses Klein and Twisted in the back end.

Haddock revolves around versions - it is designed so that you can write code for new versions of your API without disturbing old ones.

Why?
----

Because I liked the look of Praekelt's Aludel (https://github.com/praekelt/aludel) but it didn't kind of work how I thought it would. So, I wrote something similar, to play around!

How do I use it?
----------------

You need two things - the API description document, and the implementation. You can find the description document in `examples` and the example python in the root directory. Simply run `example.py` and navigate to http://localhost:8094/v1/weather?postcode=61000&unixTimestamp=1 for a demonstration.

To be more exact - Haddock maps methods from *versions* of an API onto Klein-powered routes. You have *API endpoints*, each with one or more *processors*, each of which can map onto one or more *versions*.
